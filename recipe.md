1. First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.

Usually instant yeast can be mixed directly in the flour or in water at room temperature. But I am detailing this method as it can be implemented if you are using dry active yeast. Add 2 teaspoons dry active yeast for this pizza crust recipe.
. Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.

TIP: The water has to be lukewarm and not hot or cold. Hot water will kill the yeast and cooler water won’t activate the dry active yeast.
 You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.
  Combine 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour (or bread flour) with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.
   Stir with a whisk or wooden spoon or steel spoon.
   Add one more cup of the flour.
   Keep on stirring. The mixture will be quite sticky, like in the photo below.

 Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky.
  Keep your dough in the deep bowl, and lightly apply a bit of olive oil all around the outside of the dough. This will keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl once the dough proves and grows.

Cover loosely with a kitchen napkin or towel, and let rest at room temperature for the dough to leaven:

45 minutes to 1 hour for instant yeast
1.5 to 2 hours for dry active yeast
